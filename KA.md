```
```bash
git clone <repo-name>
```
6. Ensure express is installed
```bash
npm i express
```
7. Create App file
    - create app file with desired code in project folder
8.  Run the app 
9. Push any changes to repo with git salute

**Personal experience**<br>
	My own personal experience with my first spin up came with some difficulties. This is my first time really using Git and GitHub when coding. I am very used to just saving my work on my local device and opening it again when I want to work on it. This has caused me some problems when trying to learn how to work in this new environment. The most important part was learning the Git salute. This is really the same thing as clicking save with a few extra steps. Doing the salute allows collaborators to all work on the same code together. I was very confused about how it would work when two people were coding at the same time. But after learning about merging branches into one code. This has cleared up any confusion I had.<br>
**Agile Handoff**<br>
	The best short definition I could give for an agile handoff is this: The transfer of work from one person to another. When I do this, this allows me to work on something at school in class and hand it off to myself in the future when I am working at home with ease. It allows for much communication and better informing everyone on what needs to be done using issues. Git and GitHub makes it super easy to push your code up to the repo and then pull it back down to your coding environment. Making it all a swift interaction. The first step it to commit your work that you did using the steps listed above. It is very simple after that to start working on it again. When you have people working at the same time you would work on a branch then push changes to that branch. You then would create a pull request to allow others to view the changes. After reviewing those changes you can resolve the conflits and merge the code together create one flawless product. <br><br>
